People to Thank
===============
A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into making TuneConnect what it is today, and as such, there are a lot of people that deserve great thanks for their efforts.

Beta Testers
------------
First and foremost, a big thanks to my beta testers-- without you, TuneConnect would not be quite what it is today (and it'd probably be released with a handful of debilitating Intel bugs :P).

*list of beta testers goes here*

Advice Givers
-------------
I polled a lot of people for advice on TuneConnect's direction, but a few stand out above the rest. I'd like to give a special thanks to **Andy Matuschak** ([http://andymatuschak.org](http://andymatuschak.org)), for being willing to put up with my incessant rambling; **Brendan DeBeasi** ([http://debeasi.com](http://debeasi.com)), for both testing the software and at least pretending to be excited with each new release; and **John Geleynse**, Director of User Experience Evangelism at Apple, who helped to inspire the initial direction of the Mac and iPhone TuneConnect clients.

Also, a thanks to the members of #macdev on Freenode, for answering a few sticky questions I couldn't quite figure out the answer to.

Developers
----------
Great open source software draws from pre-existing software, and combines it in such a way that a new, inventive, and powerful product emerges. Thus, TuneConnect relies on a number of libraries from various developers:

* [EMKeychain](http://extendmac.com/EMKeychain/), by Brian Amerige of extendmac, llc.
* [Shortcut Recorder](http://wafflesoftware.net/shortcut/), by Waffle Software
* [CocoaCryptoHashing](http://stoneship.org/blog/2005/04/27/cocoa-crypto-hashing/), by Denis Defreyne
* [UKLoginItemRegistry](http://www.zathras.de/angelweb/sourcecode.htm), by Uli Kusterer
* [BSJSONAdditions](http://blakeseely.com/blog/archives/2006/03/29/bsjsonadditions-12/), by Blake Seely
* [Growl](http://growl.info), by the [Growl Development Team](http://growl.info/team.php)
* [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/), by Andy Matuschak

And of course, let's not forget the developers of the complete set of Cocoa and Carbon Frameworks-- we love ya', Apple! ;)

Graphic Designers
-----------------
A Mac app isn't a Mac app unless it looks good. As such, a special shout out goes to three excellent graphic designers: **Thomas Didrel** ([http://tototoolco.com](http://tototoolco.com)), the French translator of TuneConnect and designer of the original TuneConnect website; **Adam Betts** ([http://artofadambetts.com](http://artofadambetts.com)), who was kind enough to attempt taking on the TuneConnect project icon (though he ended up being too busy); and **Laurent Baumann** ([http://lbaumann.com](http://lbaumann.com)), the designer who actually *did* end up taking on the design of the new TuneConnect icon (which looks amazing, in my oh-so-humble opinion). I owe you all!

Others
------
To anyone else who was in any way involved with the TuneConnect project, a HUGE THANKS to you all! Enjoy TuneConnect, I made it for you. :)
