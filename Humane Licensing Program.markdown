TuneConnect Humane Licensing Program
====================================
Finding a piece of good software is like finding a $20 bill in the pocket of a pair of jeans you haven't worn in awhile. Later realizing that that new application *costs* $20... well, the feeling fades away a little bit (and the money's gone).

If every piece of good software were free, it is estimated that the general population would experience a 12.415% increase in overall happiness, and global warming just *might* go away for good. Unfortunately, that isn't the case -- people get greedy, and they often forget the reasons why they started developing software in the first place.

As a student, I'm perpetually short on money, and since TuneConnect is (in my opinion, though I'm a bit biased) an absolutely amazing application, it's indeed difficult for me not to charge for it. But then, the open source bug tugs on my heart strings, and it becomes difficult *to* charge for it.

So I invented something in between: the TuneConnect Humane Licensing Program.

License Your Way
----------------
TuneConnect is released under the [GNU General Public License][gpl], so that leaves a lot of room for freedom in licensing. Particularly, the GPL makes provisions that a developer may indeed charge for open source software, among other things.

[gpl]: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html

Of important note is that TuneConnect is licensed under version 3 of the General Public License. Founder of the Free Software Foundation, Richard M. Stallman, has this to say about one of the key components of this license:

> GPLv3 ensures you are free to remove the handcuffs. It doesn't forbid DRM, or any kind of feature. It places no limits on the substantive functionality you can add to a program, or remove from it. Rather, it makes sure that you are just as free to remove nasty features as the distributor of your copy was to add them. Tivoization is the way they deny you that freedom; to protect your freedom, GPLv3 forbids tivoization.

So what exactly does that mean as applied to TuneConnect?

Basically, TuneConnect has a few "nag" devices in the clients, that remind you that the software is "undenagified." The primary way to turn these devices off is to enter a Denagification Code (the TuneConnect equivalent of a serial number). However, there is another way: you are completely free to edit the source yourself and remove any and every piece of nag code in the entire program. We even make it easy for you -- but more on that later.

In order to keep the licensing (think "denagification") process as simple, straightforward, and open as possible, I've come up with six different ways for you to denagify your copy of TuneConnect. This is the foundation of the TuneConnect Humane Licensing Program.

Method 1: Make a Donation
-------------------------
TuneConnect can be downloaded completely for free, both in source and application form. However, as countless hours of work went into the development of the software, a small bit of monetary compensation wouldn't exactly be turned away.

Making a small donation to The TuneConnect Project will earn you an instant Denagification Code. The donation can be of any amount -- a penny is acceptable. The originally-proposed retail price of TuneConnect was $7.95, so if you can't think of a better amount, just go with that. Just be aware that while it is possible that your donation will go to improve the future development of TuneConnect, that most likely *won't* be the case: I'm a student, remember?

Method 2: Become a Beta Tester
------------------------------
Another nice, easy way to denagify your software is to become a TuneConnect beta tester. All testers who download the beta, and submit at least one report on TuneConnect -- what they like, what they don't like, what works, what doesn't, whatever -- will receive a free lifetime Denagification Code. If you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours, capisce? Biggest contributors, either to the source, or in inspirational ideas, might just receive a t-shirt, mouse pad, or boxer shorts. Really, I'm not kidding.

Method 3: Write a Public Review
-------------------------------
Have a blog, or access to some kind of web posting thingamabob? Writing a publicly available review of TuneConnect will get you a Denagification Code! Just drop a link to your review in the "Review Drop-box", and within a couple of days you should receive your Denagification Code.

Please note, however, that your review must be honest, serious, and well-written. It absolutely 100% does *not* have to portray TuneConnect in a positive light -- it can tear it to shreds for all I care. But posting an article on your blog with the words "I just tried a cool app called TuneConnect, it rocks" will not suffice. Work a little bit here, people! Be specific about what you like or don't like, and why you like/dislike it. That's the only way your review can ever be useful to anyone, ya' know.

Method 4: Send me an Email
--------------------------
Love TuneConnect, but don't want to get involved in professional writing or beta testing? Low on cash? Send me an email and tell me how you use TuneConnect, along with a short explanation as to why you think you deserve a free Denagification Code. If I like your explanation, I'll send you one as soon as I can. Unique use cases will be featured on the TuneConnect website, and might even earn you a t-shirt!

Method 5: Edit the Source
-------------------------
If you've done a little bit of software development in the past, editing the source of TuneConnect and recompiling might be the second easiest way to denagify your copy. Download the source code for the software on your platform (first make sure you have the appropriate development tools installed: on Mac OS X, you need Xcode; on Windows, Visual C# Express). Then, open the file called `Denagification.txt`. The instructions in that file will walk you through exactly what you need to change in order to remove all nag devices from your software. Sure, method 6 (below) is much, much easier, but at least *working* for it a bit makes you feel less guilty, right?

Method 6: Click the "Self-Denagifier" Button
-------------------------------------------
If you're too lazy or cheap to do any of the above methods, poke around the preferences dialog in the client, and look for the Self-Denagifier button. Clicking this button will remove all of the nag devices automatically, without entering a Denagification Code. No, there's no catch, that's really all you need to do. Crazy, huh?
